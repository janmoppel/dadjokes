[![Codemagic build status](https://api.codemagic.io/apps/5c5d69d85e0ce3000fe4d7de/5c5d69d85e0ce3000fe4d7dd/status_badge.svg)](https://codemagic.io/apps/5c5d69d85e0ce3000fe4d7de/5c5d69d85e0ce3000fe4d7dd/latest_build)

A fun little app for groan-worthy dad jokes.

## For Developers

Built with [Flutter]((http://flutter.io/)), a framework for building
high-quality apps for iOS and Android from a single codebase.

This is a small project to demonstrate a few useful Flutter features.

Requires Flutter v0.10.2 or later.
